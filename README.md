# Clothes Size PRediction 👚

### 📊 Overview
This project predicts clothing size based on height, weight, and age.  
It was my first complete Machine Learning pipeline — including data processing, feature engineering, model training, and inference.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Modular pipelines for ETL, EDA, feature engineering, training & inference

### 📈 Results
Best model: Logistic Regression  
Accuracy: ~42.5%

> Even though performance wasn’t high, this project focuses on the pipeline architecture and reproducibility.
